# MY AUDITS

## PrePO

_Background_
PrePO is a preIPO platform that allows users to bet on the valuation of an asset in the pre IPO stage. Users can mint synthetic long/short tokens that increase in value if valuation increases/drops. These long/short tokens can be pooled in UniV3 pools where LP's can earn any trading fees.

_Submission_
I found 7 issues and [submitted](./code4rena/prePO/findings.md) them to Code4rena.

_Outcome_
